This is a random generation of people living a duration of no less than three weeks to sixteen weeks under constant harassment of a high level. It is not a true indication of how many people are killed through government harassment, just a possibility if the corrupt federal officer is akin to a war criminal or commits crimes against humanity against the populous whom they were trusted to protect. If the individual lasts longer than twelve weeks it is assumed that the individual will live past that; however, if the harassment continues the individual is likely to pass regardless.
The sad truth is that not all of these individuals are guilty. This is due to the nature of humanity in relation to the corrupts belief that someone is guilty. As we are not always right and officers are lied to by both the public and themselves one hundred percent certainty is not a possibility. So the innocent are also victims of harassment and sadly sometimes it is their demise.
That said, not all officers are corrupt, but it is a major problem in all government agencies.
Due to the nature of federal police and the crimes they investigate, emotions run high in regards to criminals and the wish to punish would be higher. So, the example focuses on them.
