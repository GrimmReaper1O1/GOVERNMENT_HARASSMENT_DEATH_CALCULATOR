        <h1>GOVERNMENT HARRASSMENT DEATH CALCULATOR!</h1>

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <h3>Disclaimer!!!</h3>
        <p>Viewer discression is advised. Some may find this information distressing. It is advised that anyone who may be triggered by this information 
            stop reading it immediately!</p>
            <p>This is not a precise measurement of actual numbers as these figures would no doubt be hidden from the public if they even exist in the first place.</p>
            <p>Due to the nature of corruption it is impossible to truly gauge the results on average of harrassment, but given a random nature of severe harassment bordering 
                on crimes against humanity the figures stipulate with random timeframes between 3 weeks of survival to four months of survival. It is assumed that people won't 
                commit suicide within three weeks and that anyone who lives past three months will continue to survive at least for a long duration further.
            </p>
            <p>Again this is not neccessarily an accurate representation of police corruption or harrassement from any government authority, but a possible thought
                about what it entails. A federal police officer team is more likely to enact such a practice if corrupt as they investigate crimes they are likely 
                to harrass an individual for longer durations for. The truth is due to the fact that people lie and the officers even lie towards each other, especially
                the corrupt ones, the innocent are within the mix. Unless you can always state you are correct how can you assume they are. Court doesn't eventuate if 
                the police don't have enough evidence to prosecute, harrassment entails from the corrupt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to the random nature of these killings, this document recalculates the possible outcome every time it is loaded.
            </p></div>

            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>This is a random generation of people living a duration of no less than three weeks to sixteen weeks under constant harassment of a high level. It is not a true indication of how many people are killed through government harassment, just a possibility if the corrupt federal officer is akin to a war criminal or commits crimes against humanity against the populous whom they were trusted to protect. If the individual lasts longer than twelve weeks it is assumed that the individual will live past that; however, if the harassment continues the individual is likely to pass regardless.</p>
            <p>The sad truth is that not all of these individuals are guilty. This is due to the nature of humanity in relation to the corrupts belief that someone is guilty. As we are not always right and officers are lied to by both the public and themselves one hundred percent certainty is not a possibility. So the innocent are also victims of harassment and sadly sometimes it is their demise.</p>
            <p>That said, not all officers are corrupt, but it is a major problem in all government agencies.</p>
            <p>Due to the nature of federal police and the crimes they investigate, emotions run high in regards to criminals and the wish to punish would be higher. So, the example focuses on them.</p>
